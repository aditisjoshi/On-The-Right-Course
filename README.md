# On-The-Right-Course #

## Description
On The Right Course is a data-visualization tool that helps Olin students decide what classes to register for in the next semester. We have taken all of Olin's past registration data, cleaning it up, and then displaying it. Students can then go in an filter by major and/or semester to track their own journey. 

## Running the Code 
If you are on Olin's network, you can easily access our GUI by going to http://deepthought.olin.edu:5000/. Unfortunately, because of confidentiality issues, we cannot upload the data to github, so you cannot run our data analysis file. However, our GUI runs off of pre-created images, so you can run our run.py file locally to see what the final product looks like. 
If you already have flask installed, you can run our code with the following:
```
$ python run.py
```
If you don't have flask, you can use [this great tutorial.] (http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). This will lead you to create a separate folder that has python from which you can run our file. If you did this, you would then run the following:
```
$ python ~/flask/bin/python run.py
```
You would then have a locally running instance of our code (you would probably see the following):
```
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
* Restarting with stat
```
You could then access our GUI and have fun looking at the data visualizations we created.
