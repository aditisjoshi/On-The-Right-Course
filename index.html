  <h1 class="title">On The Right Course</h1>

  <p>When Olin College course registration period comes around, the question, &quot;What class should I take?&quot; always pops up. Because several factors fall into choosing a course, Olin students are left to wonder what class they are not only able to take, but also need to take.</p><p>Our project is called On The Right Course. Simply, it is an online tool to help Olin students decide what classes to take. The way it will do this is through an interactive data visualization. The homepage will provide students the opportunity to filter for the type of information they want to view, filtering based on major and semester. After submitting the filtering criteria,the most frequently taken classes that satisfy the filters are displayed.</p>


     <h2 id="technical">Go to Olin College?</h2>
     <h3 id='olininfo'>Type in <a href='http://deepthought.olin.edu:5000/'>http://deepthought.olin.edu:5000/</a> and see magic happen.</h3>

    <h2>Implimentaiton of Our Code</h2>
    <p>The code for On the Right Course can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/aditisjoshi/On-The-Right-Course">Github repo</a></p>
    <h3>Librarires</h3>
    <h4>Pandas</h4>
    <p>pandas is a very powerful tool for data structures. By using pandas, we were able to convert our .csv data into an indexed dataFrame that enables quick and easy reference of values within the columns and rows of the dataFrame.</p>

    <h4>MatPlotLib</h4>
    <p>This plotting library was primarily used for the visualization of the horizontal bars that represented the top ten results after filtering the data.</p>
    
    <h4>Flask</h4>
    <p>Flask was used to integrate our python backend with an html/css front-end.</p>


    <h3>Data Processing</h3>
    <h4>CourseDF</h4>
    <p>This class takes in the raw pandas dataFrame and cleans it up to prepare it for the filtering process. This includes the following functions:</p>
    <center><img src='CourseDF.png'></center>
    <dl>
      <dt>semLabel</dt>
      <dd>labels the semesters with a consistent numbering convention</dd>
      <dt>majorAssignment</dt>
      <dd>updates undeclared major statuses to the major status at graduation</dd>
      <dt>OSS</dt>
      <dd>simplifies specific titles for Olin Self Study courses to &quot;Olin Self Study in __&quot;</dd>
      <dt>oldCourses</dt>
      <dd>removes any course that has not been offered in the past four years</dd>
      <dt>AHScount</dt>
      <dd>simplifies and combines Arts, Humanities, Sciences, and Entrepreneurship courses under generic titles to &quot;1st AHSE Class, 2nd AHSE Class, 3rd AHSE Class&quot; and so on</dd>
      <dt>courseNames</dt>
      <dd>removes irregularities in course titles by pairing the course numbers with their latest used course titles</dd>
      <dt>dataCleaning</dt>
      <dd>runs all the above functions on the main dataFrame</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>FilterDF</h4>
    <p>This class runs the filtering functions depending on the semester or major filter that was selected. The resultant object is either a single dataFrame (specified semester scenario) or a list of eight dataFrames (unspecified semester scenario). This includes the follow functions:</p>
    <center><img src='FilterDF.PNG'></center>
    <dl>
      <dt>capped_percent</dt>
      <dd>takes a dataFrame and calculates the percentage of students that take a course in a given semester and outputs a dataFrame with the top then enrolled courses</dd>
      <dt>semFilter</dt>
      <dd>filters dataFrame to data that is associated with specified semester</dd>
      <dt>semFilter</dt>
      <dd>ffilters dataFrame to data that is associated with specified major</dd>
      <dt>output8Sem</dt>
      <dd>runs the semFilter function eight times to prepare a list of 8 dataFrames for the unspecified semester scenarios</dd>
      <dt>filter</dt>
      <dd>runs the above functions to on the main dataFrame to output either a single dataFrame or a list of 8 dataFrames</dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>RenderDF</h4>
    <p>This class takes the filtered dataFrames as an input and outputs stylized bar charts that reflect the top ten courses. This includes the following functions:</p>
    <center><img src='RenderDF.PNG'></center>
    <dl>
      <dt>addPercentSymbol</dt>
      <dd>for visualization purposes, converts the numeric values to a string that includes the percent symbol</dd>
      <dt>plot</dt>
      <dd>set-up and stylize the matplotlib plot</dd>
      <dt>render</dt>
      <dd>runs the plot function and saves them as images, generates and saves 8 images for unspecified semester scenario</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>HTML Integration</h3>
    <p>Using Flask, we were able to integrate python with with html/css. First, we created a page where students understood what we were doing and how to filter the information. From this, we got the semester and/or major that they wanted to filter for. These were passed through a filter function which gathered all of the necessary graphs. Then, depending on whether they were looking at all semesters or one semester, a page was generated where they could see the appropriate graphs. If they chose to filter again, they would click the filter again button which would redirect them to the home page. </p>     


    <h2>The End Result</h2>
    <p>We ended up creating a really useful GUI for Olin students. Students on campus can access the program using a supercomputer. Off campus, everyone can download our code and look at the GUI themselves <a href="https://github.com/aditisjoshi/On-The-Right-Course">(see our GitHub repo with instructions on exactly how to do this)</a>. The tool is not only useful for Olin students, but to the larger Olin community, because it gives insights as to course trajectories of students accross the history of the school. In the future, we hope to expand this to be used on our course registration website. Also, it would be useful to create a way for students to remove certain classes that perhaps they have already taken to customize it to their specific schedule. Hopefully, however, On the Right Course makes course registration a little easier for Olin students by giving them a lot of institutional information in a useable way.</p>


    <h2>Attribution and Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>This tool would not have been possible without the help of the Software Design professors, Paul Ruvolo and Ben Hill. Much appreciation goes to Jeremy Goodman and Linda Canavan for supplying the Olin registration data that fuels this entire project. And finally, a huge thank you goes out to our Software Design NINJAs and peers for pointing out both the subtle and obvious mistakes in our code.</p>
