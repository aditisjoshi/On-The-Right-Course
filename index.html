        <p id="subtitle">Are you ever confused about what class to take next semester? Are you plagued by dreams of not graduating on time because you missed that one requirement? Well, we've taken all of Olin's past course data and created a tool that will let you use all of the old course registration information to decide what time is the best time to take certain classes. You can zoom into one major and semester or look at all students at a whole. Ready to never have registration frustration?</p>
